Summarizes the analysis (5 points)

* Through out this analysis it became evident that although charter schools trend to
have less spending budget per student than district financed schools, charter schools outperform district-financed schools in their math and reading scores.

* The district in question is composed of 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students.8 of these schools are considered charter schools, and 7 of them district school. 

Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)

* 1). The largest district school in the sample has 4976 students, and 54.64% students passing and the 
#largest passing charter school with 2283 students has 90.58% of the students passing. Natural assumptions
#that come into mind are that with smaller school the teacher to student ratio is much smaller, and students are able
#to indulge in moe attention from the teachers. 
#
* 2). Concluding the analysis, from a parent perspective, the data favors charter school education based on the overall passing 
#percentage. Charter schools have a 90.43% overall passing and  district-funded schools have 53.67%
