## Summary

This project provides an analysis of educational data comparing charter schools and district-funded schools in a particular district. The analysis reveals interesting insights regarding the spending budget per student and the performance in math and reading scores.

## Key Findings

1. **Spending Budget and Performance**: The analysis demonstrates that, despite having a lower spending budget per student, charter schools outperform district-funded schools in both math and reading scores. This suggests that factors other than financial resources play a significant role in student performance.

2. **School Composition**: The district under consideration consists of a total of 15 schools, out of which 8 are charter schools and 7 are district-funded schools. This information helps provide context for the subsequent analysis and comparisons.

## Conclusions and Comparisons

1. **Impact of School Size**: The analysis reveals that the largest district-funded school in the sample has 4,976 students, with a pass rate of 54.64%. On the other hand, the largest charter school, with 2,283 students, boasts a pass rate of 90.58%. These findings suggest that smaller charter schools may offer a more favorable student-to-teacher ratio, allowing for greater individual attention and potentially contributing to higher student success rates.

2. **Parental Perspective**: From a parental standpoint, the data overwhelmingly favors charter school education based on the overall passing percentage. Charter schools have an impressive overall passing rate of 90.43%, while district-funded schools lag behind with a passing rate of 53.67%. This information suggests that parents seeking a high-quality education for their children may find charter schools to be a more promising option.

By presenting these findings and drawing relevant conclusions, this analysis sheds light on the performance and characteristics of charter schools compared to district-funded schools in the specified district.
